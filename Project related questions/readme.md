## ðŸ’¬ Interview Q&A

### 1. Can you walk me through your recent onboarding platform project?
> I worked on a platform that automates how new team members are onboarded. We used Snowflake and Matillion for data management, which sped up the onboarding process by 25%. I handled the backend pipelines with Airflow and Python on GCP, ensuring everything was automated and scalable.

---

### 2. What was your role specifically in this project?
> I designed and built ETL pipelines, optimized Snowflake queries, and managed Airflow DAGs. I also integrated Azure DevOps for CI/CD and AWS services like S3 and DynamoDB for certain data flows. I collaborated with both backend and frontend teams to ensure data availability and functionality.

---

### 3. Why did you choose Snowflake and Matillion?
> Snowflake's scalability and ease of use made it ideal for our data needs. Matillion offered fast, low-code ETL development and seamless integration with Snowflake and cloud storage, which helped us save time during development.

---

### 4. Can you explain how you optimized the Snowflake SQL queries?
> I reviewed the query execution plans and implemented clustering, simplified joins, and utilized Snowflake's caching. These adjustments led to a 30% performance improvement, especially for high-traffic queries.

---

### 5. How did Airflow help in this project?
> Airflow automated our entire ETL workflow. I used it to schedule jobs, orchestrate Matillion tasks, and trigger validations. We also added monitoring and logging to make troubleshooting easier.

---

### 6. What was the biggest challenge in this project?
> Integrating different tools like Snowflake, Matillion, and GCP smoothly was a challenge. Identifying root causes when a pipeline failed required structured logs and checkpoints, which I implemented to ease future debugging.

---

### 7. How did you measure the improvement in onboarding efficiency?
> We compared average onboarding times before and after the platform launch. Automation and optimized data flow led to a 25% time reduction, validated through logs and stakeholder feedback.

---

### 8. How did you collaborate with cross-functional teams?
> I worked closely with engineering, HR, and business teams. I gathered requirements, translated them into data pipelines, and shared insights using dashboards. Regular check-ins helped align progress and priorities.

---

### 9. What cloud services did you use and how were they integrated?
> I used GCP for orchestration and storage, Azure DevOps for deployment pipelines, and AWS (S3, DynamoDB) for data ingestion. I used Python to manage secure data transfers and integrated credentials via service accounts.

---

### 10. What was the most rewarding aspect of this project?
> Seeing teams get onboarded faster and hearing feedback about how much smoother the process was felt great. I liked how something I built directly made peopleâ€™s work easier.

---

### 11. Did you face any failures in your pipeline? How did you handle them?
> Yes, there were times when jobs failed due to schema drift or network issues. I built retry mechanisms in Airflow, added logging, and updated scripts to handle dynamic schema detection. This helped us recover gracefully without manual intervention.

---

### 12. How did you collaborate with non-technical stakeholders?
> I created Power BI dashboards to show onboarding metrics and used simple visualizations during sprint reviews. I made sure to relate our technical progress to their business impact.
